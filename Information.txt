Method Overloading - When a class has two or more methods by the same name but different parameters, it is known as method overloading.
It is different from overriding. In overriding, a method has the same method name, type, number of parameters, etc.
Let’s consider the example discussed earlier for finding minimum numbers of integer type.
If, let’s say we want to find the minimum number of double type!
Then the concept of overloading will be introduced to create two or more methods with the same name but different parameters.
